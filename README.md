# Sentiment-Analysis
A model where you give a text input and the model outputs the emotion presented in the text.

# How to Run?
You can run the Jupyter notebook, skip training if you wish to (there's a pre trained model in the repository for that case!), and finally experiment with your own sentences in the testing module.
